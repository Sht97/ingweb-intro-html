        <h1>Great rock bands in history</h1>
        <p style="margin: 35px;">Rock’s origins can be traced to the late 1940s, when the popular styles of the day, country music and blues,
            morphed into a new sound aided by electric guitars and a steady drumbeat. Pioneering rock artists of the 1950s such
            as Chuck Berry leaned heavily on classic blues structures while demonstrating a flair as natural-born entertainers.
            In contrast to the safe pop music of the era, rock’s aggressive attack suggested a sexual freedom that was shocking
            during that conservative age.
